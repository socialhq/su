If that is not sufficient, a new setting, \"shell_timeout\",\n    has been added, which can be set to the desired amount of time in seconds.\n  \n  - When searching for executables, ~ is expanded in PATH components.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.30\n  ---------------------\n  - When module import fails, the log message is more specific about\n    the consequences of that failure.\n  \n  - Fixed the case where non-version-sensitive python linters would fail\n    to lint when a python 3 module was not available.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.29\n  ---------------------\n  - Debug mode is now logged at startup.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.28\n  ---------------------\n  \n  I am very grateful to everyone who has created linter plugins and made\n  the commitment to maintain and support them.\n  \n  SublimeLinter is only as good as its linters, so I feel every linter\n  released to the public should be up to the standards I am holding\n  myself to with SublimeLinter. As a result, I have taken the following\n  step:\n  \n  - We have moved all of the SublimeLinter linter plugins to a private channel.\n    In the future, any requests for publishing through Package Control will\n    be vetted for basic correctness.\n  \n  - Linter plugins that are not in the SublimeLinter org on github have\n    been renamed to SublimeLinter-contrib-*, so users can know that these\n    are user-contributed, vs. the \"official\" linters in the SublimeLinter\n    org.\n  \n  - When creating a linter plugin using the \"Create Linter Plugin\" command,\n    the name is SublimeLinter-contrib-* name.\n  \n  Of course I want as many linters as possible in the SublimeLinter org.\n  Anyone who is willing to have their plugin vetted and is willing to\n  maintain and support their linter will be welcome in the org.\n  \n  Thank you for your support!\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.27\n  ---------------------\n  - Added fixed HTML (Rails) syntax to correctly support ERB files.\n  \n  - Fixed the path for the Default gutter theme.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.26\n  ---------------------\n  - I have switched back to .zshenv as the recommended place\n    to put PATH augmentations for zsh. On Ubuntu, shells are\n    not started as login shells by default in terminals, which\n    prevented .zprofile from loading. If anyone has trouble\n    using .zshenv, let me know.\n  \n  - Added Retina icons for the Default and Circle gutter themes.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.25\n  ---------------------\n  - If you have multiple views of the same buffer open, even in multiple\n    windows, the highlights, gutter marks and status messages are kept in sync.\n  \n  - On Mac OS X, a syntax file will load even if the capitalization of its\n    filename extension is not \".tmLanguage\". On other platforms it will not\n    load. But since it at least works on Mac OS X, SublimeLinter will allow\n    it when resolving syntaxes.\n  \n  - Added CONTRIBUTING.md, so github issues will showing something about\n    the guidelines for contributing.\n  \n  - Linter.config_file now allows for an abitrary number of auxiliary\n    search directories to be searched, and '~' is expanded. This allows\n    for linters like jshint to provide the native functionality of\n    searching the file hierarchy and the home directory.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.24\n  ---------------------\n  - A new linter setting has been added, \"ignore_match\",\n    which allows you to ignore errors based on the error message.\n    For more information, please see the documentation:\n  \n    http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/linter_settings.html#ignore-match\n  \n  - A Dash doc feed is now available so you can read the\n    SublimeLinter docs within Dash and they will always stay\n    up to date with the latest version.\n  \n    dash-feed://https%3A//media.readthedocs.org/dash/sublimelinter/latest/sublimelinter.xml\n  \n\n  ******************\n  * Exciting news! *\n  ******************\n  \n  After another week of hard work, I'm very happy\n  and excited to announce that the SublimeLinter 3\n  documentation has gone to a much better place...\n  \n  http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org\n  \n  It's indexed, searchable, mobile-ready, and\n  beautiful. Read those docs!\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.23\n  ---------------------\n  - If no gutter marks are showing and there is no column in\n    an error message, the entire line is highlighted.\n  \n  - When specifying inline settings, \"SublimeLinter\" is now\n    case-insensitive, so for example both \"[SublimeLinter flake8-ignore:E201]\"\n    and \"[sublimelinter flake8-ignore:E201]\" will work.\n  \n  - If you are using a node-based linter (like jshint), nvm,\n    zsh, and oh-my-zsh, do **not** install the nvm plugin for\n    oh-my-zsh. It interferes with SublimeLinter’s ability to\n    find the path to node.\n  \n  - Fixed some bugs relating to default settings.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.20\n  ---------------------\n  - When using the \"Create Linter Plugin\" command, an executable name\n    with dashes will be converted into a camel-case class name. For\n    example, scss-lint becomes ScssLint.\n  \n  - Added .gitignore with .DS_Store to the linter plugin template.\n  \n  - You may now define a linter as file-only by setting its tempfile_suffix\n    to '-', which means that linter will only run when its view is not dirty.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.19\n  ---------------------\n  - Previously, when a linter plugin name had a dash in it, for example\n    SublimeLinter-foo-bar, the inline setting name was \"foobar\",\n    which could lead to confusion. Now both \"foobar\" and \"foo-bar\"\n    are recognized as inline setting names.\n  \n  - Fixed a bug with argument generation in some linters.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.18\n  ---------------------\n  - Hopefully dealing correctly with gems under rbenv/rvm now.\n  \n  - Added Linter.config_file attribute for automating config file\n    lookup. See the Writing Linters docs for more info.\n  \n  - @ may be used as a prefix for arguments in the Linter.defaults attribute.\n    It suppresses output of the arg name, allowing you to use a named\n    inline setting/override and only have the values passed in the\n    linter command. See the Writing Linters docs for more info.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.17\n  --------------------\n  \n  - Fixed possible hang if a long-running process was started\n    in the shell startup files. (SublimeLinter3-#30)\n  \n  - If unable to read the shell PATH, you are warned that\n    linters will most likely not work.\n  \n  - Re-added ability to use @ filename placeholder in the cmd\n    when the linter accepts stdin. (SublimeLinter-#618)\n  \n  - Fixed the character offset of highlights on the first\n    line of a selector region. (annotations-#1)\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.16\n  ---------------------\n  \n  - Fixed crashes related to missing settings.\n  \n  - If the PATH output from your shell cannot be parsed,\n    an error message is printed to the console.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.15\n  ---------------------\n  \n  - A new method was added, persist.debug_mode, to make it easier\n    for linter plugins to determine if the user has debug mode\n    turned on. Returns True if \"debug\" setting is on.\n  \n  - Linters can now declare themselves as universal by setting\n    the syntax to '*'. '*' can also be used as a key in selectors.\n    See the SublimeLinter-annotations plugin for an example.\n  \n  - When specifying a list setting as a string, for example:\n  \n      \"annotations\": {\n          \"warnings\": \"FOO, BAR\",\n      }\n  \n    in non-inline setting you can now put whitespace around\n    the separator. Note that space may not be used around the\n    separator if the setting is inline.\n  \n  - Fixed some problems related to unexpected ST3 behavior.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.12\n  ---------------------\n  \n  - A new Linter method was added, get_user_args, to make it easy\n    for linter plugins to get the \"args\" setting and be sure\n    it's a list.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.11\n  ---------------------\n  \n  - Support was added for ruby-based linters via a new RubyLinter class.\n    This class makes ruby-based linters work with rbenv and (hopefully)\n    rvm. It also preserves your GEM_HOME when running ruby-based linters.\n    See the documentation for more info.\n  \n  - Some linters use html entitities in the error messages, so html\n    entities in error messages are now decoded.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.10\n  ---------------------\n  \n  - Linting unsaved files works correctly now.\n  \n  - When a linter plugin is loaded successfully, the console will say \"<linter> activated\" instead of \"linter enabled\". In addition, if the linter is disabled in your settings at load time, it will say so in the activation message, to make it clear the linter is active but not currently enabled.\n  \n  - Non-string values may be used for lists of values in linter settings.\n  \n  - When loading the first python-based linter on Windows, a command prompt window briefly opened. This has been fixed.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.9\n  --------------------\n  \n  - There are new commands to toggle, enable, or disable a linter.\n    No need to go hunting through the settings.\n  \n  - Please note that the recommended place for PATH changes with zsh\n    is .zshenv instead of .zprofile.\n  \n\n  SublimeLinter 3.0.6\n  --------------------\n  \n  - Fixed a bug in setting mark style and lint mode\n    through the Command Palette.\n  \n  - Show All Errors moves the selection to the highlighted error\n    as you move through the items.\n  \n  - Live preview of mark styles when choosing from the Command Palette.\n  \n",
